# Determinants and Matrix Inversion
## Economic application
### Applying algebra to systems of equations
#### What are we learning all of these operations for?
- We really want to be able to solve a system of equations!
- What do we need to be able to do that??

<!-- %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% New slide %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% -->
<!-- %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% New slide %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% -->

### Ultimately we need the inverse matrix!!
#### Why?
- If we look at the system of equations we introduced at the beginning.
$$
    \begin{bmatrix}
        a_{11} & a_{12} & a_{13} & \dots & a_{1n}\\
        a_{21} & a_{22} & a_{23} & \dots & a_{2n}\\
        \vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots\\
        a_{m1} & a_{m2} & a_{m3} & \dots & a_{mn}
    \end{bmatrix}
    \cdot
    \begin{bmatrix}
        x_1\\
        x_2\\
        \vdots\\
        x_n
    \end{bmatrix} =
    \begin{bmatrix}
        b_1\\
        b_2\\
        \vdots\\
        b_m
    \end{bmatrix}
$$

### Then rewrite the matrix and two vectors:
- We can replace the matrix of coefficients with some generic letter for the matrix, lets call it $\mathbf{A}$, and then we can do the same for the vector of variables ($\mathbf{\overrightarrow{x}}$), and the results vector on the right ($\mathbf{\overrightarrow{b}}$). Then we have $$\mathbf{A\overrightarrow{x}} = \mathbf{\overrightarrow{b}}$$
- Or just, $$\mathbf{Ax} = \mathbf{b}$$

<!-- %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% New slide %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% -->
<!-- %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% New slide %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% -->

### Then re-arrange the variables:
- If we know the values for $\mathbf{\overrightarrow{b}}$, and,
- If we want to find a solution for all values for our unknowns (the $\mathbf{x}$ vector), we somehow need to get the matrix $\mathbf{A}$ to the right-hand side of our equation.
- If $\mathbf{A}$ was just a regular variable, $j$, we could just divide both sides by $j$.
- This could also be written as both sides multiplied by $j^{-1}$. We would want something like: $$\overrightarrow{x} = \mathbf{A^{-1}\overrightarrow{b}}$$

<!-- %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% New slide %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% -->
<!-- %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% New slide %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% -->

### Dividing by a matrix is not possible!! But...
- In matrices, there is a very similar concept, except that: $$\mathbf{A^{-1}A} = \mathbf{I}$$
- Where $\mathbf{I}$ is the Identity matrix!!!

<!-- %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% New slide %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% -->
<!-- %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% New slide %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% -->

### Dividing both sides by a matrix not possible:
- Just as $j^{-1}j = \frac{j}{j}=1$
- $\mathbf{A^{-1}A} = \mathbf{I}$, where $\mathbf{I}$ is the Identity matrix!!!
- We can therefore rewrite: $$\mathbf{Ax} = \mathbf{b}$$
- As: $$\mathbf{A^{-1}Ax} = \mathbf{A^{-1}b}$$
- because we know that $$\mathbf{A^{-1}A} = \mathbf{I}$$

<!-- %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% New slide %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% -->
<!-- %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% New slide %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% -->

### Multiplying by the inverse is equal to **I**
- And any matrix multiplied by the identity matrix is just equal to the original matrix.
- We can write $$\mathbf{Ix} = \mathbf{A^{-1}b}$$
- Which is the same as: $$\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{A^{-1}b}$$
- In this way, if we can find the **inverse** of a matrix:
- For any set of outcomes, $\mathbf{b}$, 
- We can find a solution for all variables in the vector $\mathbf{x}$.

<!-- %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% New slide %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% -->
<!-- %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% New slide %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% -->

### Great! So how do we get the inverse?
#### Here I highly recommend you watch some videos!!
- The inverse, is that one specific matrix, that if we find the **dot product** of it with our original matrix, we get the **identity matrix**.
- There are a few ways that we can do this, but the methods all boil down to being able to this equation: $$\mathbf{A}^{-1} = \frac{1}{|A|}(adj.(\mathbf{A}))$$
- Where $|A|$, is the determinant of matrix $\mathbf{A}$, and
- Where, $adj.(\mathbf{A})$ is the adjugate matrix of matrix $\mathbf{A}$.


<!-- %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% New slide %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% -->
<!-- %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% New slide %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% -->

### The adjugate
- We also have an equation to tell us how to work out the adjugate of $\mathbf{A}$, it is: $$adj.(\mathbf{A}) = \mathbf{C}^{T}$$
- Where, $\mathbf{C}^{T}$ is the **transpose** of the **coefficient matrix** of $\mathbf{A}$.

<!-- %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% New slide %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% -->
<!-- %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% New slide %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% -->

### Ingredients to the inverse
\begin{block}{The Adjugate}
\end{block}
- Which includes:
    1. The coefficient matrix ($\mathbf{C}^{T}$)
    2. A tranpose transformation 

\begin{block}{The Determinant}
\end{block}
- This is an area that we still need to explore!
- The [geometric intuition](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip3X9LOh2dk&index=6&list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab)
is very useful! (Although it may make your brain squeal)

## Dot products and cross products
### Dot and Cross products - Advanced Understanding
#### The dot product
- [Geometric intuition](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyGKycYT2v0&list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab&index=9)
- You will need to watch the first 8 videos first to follow this video.

#### The cross product
- [Geometric intuition](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyGKycYT2v0&list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab&index=10)
- Again, you will need to watch the previous videos in the series.

## Determinant for a $2x2$ matrix
### The determinant
#### Notation
-   For matrix $\mathbf{A}$, this would be denoted as det($\mathbf{A}$), or $|\mathbf{A}|$

### Calculating the determinant in a $2\times 2$ matrix
$$
\mathbf{A}=
    \begin{bmatrix}
        a_{11} & a_{12} \\
        a_{21} & a_{22}
    \end{bmatrix}
$$

- The determinant is equal to:
- The product of the diagonal that goes **top-left** to **bottom-right**,
minus
- The product of the diagonal that goes from *bottom-left* to *top-right*.
- This is equivalent to: $(a_{11}\cdot a_{22}) - (a_{21}\cdot a_{12})$
